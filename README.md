First of all, to start the Practical Test, I created a Wordpress instance using InstaWP (you can find the login details in the email I sent you).
I implemented the test's tasks via WP Admin, with a little bit of HTML and JavaScript code at Task 3.
Now I will go through all the tasks, one by one, and explain how I solved them.

1. Category Page Structure:
For this task, I went to Articles -> Categories, I set up a new category called "Arbusti" and then I set up a subcategory for it, called "Afin", exactly like in the example page.

2. User Account Management:
For this task, I used a plugin called "User Registration", which offers an easy-to-use login process, a registration form and also a login form. You can find them in the main menu of the website.

3. Favorites Feature:
For this task, I used a combination of HTML and JavaScript code, in order to create a button which when clicked, the page is added to favorites. It is not a full implementation of the feature, because I only change the text shown on the button, but the favorite status is persistent.

4. Editable Sidebar:
I created a sidebar below the "Add to Favorites" section, with the help of Gutenberg Editor. I selected the Sidebar block and I replicated the information from the example page. Anyone can edit it. How? All you need to do is to log into the WP Admin Dashboard and open the category page. Then, at the top black bar, there is an option called "Edit website", which will take you exactly to the category edit page, where the sidebar can be edited by simply clicking on it and on its elements.

5. Recent Articles Display:
For this task, I firstly created 4 articles for that category and, with the help of Gutenberg editor, at the bottom of the page I added the Last Posts block, which I set to the last 2 posts to be shown.

6. Discussion Topics Display:
I used another plugin, called wpForo, which helped me implement this functionality, and I added 5 discussion topics from the example page (each one of them has a reply too). Although, in the category page, I added the discussion topics manually, I didn't know exactly how to add a loop with them, so I added them manually and customized them also.

7. Discussion URL Format:
As you will see in my page, when you click a discussion topic, the topic URL follows the correct format: forum/informatii-despre/topic-name.

8. Discussion Reply Functionality:
I had this functionality in my plugin and I used it, but the reply form only includes fields for text response and photo upload.

9. Responsive Design:
The elements are fully responsive, thanks to using Gutenberg editor.

10. Content and Images:
I used the content and images from the example page.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In conclusion, I managed to implement most of the tasks and their functionality, with some small exceptions which I spoke about earlier. It took me around 6 to 7 hours to get all the tasks done.

Thank you!

Yours sincerely,
